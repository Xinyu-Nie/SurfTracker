# SurfTracker
Probabilistic tractography in Superficial White Matter. This method enables the reconstruction of the fiber tracts in Superficial White Matter, which has a sheer structure with high curvature. This tracking algorithm works on the triangular mesh of the white matter and overcomes the difficulties of conventional tractography.

This tractography algorithm was developed in both C++ and Matlab versions. Please check the Readme in the corresponding folder for details of usage.
